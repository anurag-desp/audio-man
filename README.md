# Audio Man
Audio Man is an audio manipulation tool. I created it help my professor split directories of large audio files or rename all files in a directory (he uses Windows :|). I thought this might help others as well. 

## Usage
- You can clone this repo and use the functions directly
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Or, you can download the desktop app (that I haven't developed yet, lol) and use the GUI
